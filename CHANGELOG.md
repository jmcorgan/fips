# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### IPv6 Adapter

- Pre-seed identity cache from configured peer npubs at startup, so TUN
  packets can be dispatched immediately without waiting for handshake
  completion ([@v0l](https://github.com/v0l))

#### Mesh Peer Transports

- Tor transport with SOCKS5 outbound, directory-mode onion service
  inbound, and optional control port monitoring
- DNS hostname support in peer addresses for UDP and TCP transports
- Non-blocking transport connect for connection-oriented transports
  (TCP, Tor)

### Fixed

- DNS responder returned NXDOMAIN for A queries on valid `.fips` names,
  causing resolvers to give up without trying AAAA. Now returns NOERROR
  with empty answers for non-AAAA queries on resolvable names.
  (#9, reported by [@alopatindev](https://github.com/alopatindev))
- Stale end-to-end session left in session table after peer removal blocked
  session re-establishment on reconnect — `remove_active_peer` now cleans
  up `self.sessions` and `self.pending_tun_packets`.
  (#5, [@v0l](https://github.com/v0l))
- `schedule_reconnect` reset exponential backoff to zero on each link-dead
  cycle instead of preserving accumulated retry count.
  (#5, [@v0l](https://github.com/v0l))
- FMP/FSP rekey dual-initiation race on high-latency links (Tor): both
  sides' timers fired simultaneously, both msg1s crossed in flight, each
  side's responder path destroyed the initiator state. Fixed with
  deterministic tie-breaker (smaller NodeAddr wins as initiator).
- Parent selection SRTT gate bypass: `evaluate_parent` used default cost
  1.0 for peers filtered out by `has_srtt()`, defeating the MMP eligibility
  gate. Now skips unmeasured candidates when any peer has cost data.
- FSP rekey cutover race: initiator cut over before responder received msg3,
  causing AEAD failures. Fixed by deferring initiator cutover by 2 seconds.
- MMP metric discontinuity after rekey: receiver state carried stale
  counters across rekey, inflating reorder counts and jitter. Fixed via
  `reset_for_rekey()`.
- Auto-connect peers exhausted `max_retries` on initial connection failures
  and were permanently abandoned. Now retry indefinitely with exponential
  backoff capped at 300 seconds.
- Control socket permissions: non-root users couldn't connect. Daemon now
  chowns socket and directory to `root:fips` group at bind time.
- Post-rekey jitter spikes: old-session frames arriving via the drain window
  produced 2,000–7,000ms jitter spikes that corrupted the EWMA estimator.
  Added a 15-second grace period after rekey cutover that suppresses jitter
  updates until drain-window frames have flushed. (#10)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added (Initial Release)

#### Session Layer (FSP)

- End-to-end encrypted datagram service between mesh nodes addressed by Nostr npub
- Noise XK sessions with mutual authentication, replay protection, and forward secrecy
- Automatic session rekeying with configurable time/message thresholds and drain window for in-flight packets
- Port multiplexing for multiple services over a single session
- Session-layer metrics: sender/receiver reports with RTT, jitter, delivery ratio, and burst loss tracking
- Passive RTT measurement via spin bit

#### IPv6 Adapter

- IPv6 adapter interface allowing tunneling TCP/IPv6 through FIPS mesh
  for traditional IP applications (TUN interface)
- DNS resolver allowing IP applications to reach nodes by npub.fips name
- Host-to-npub static mappings: resolve `hostname.fips` via host map
  populated from peer config aliases and `/etc/fips/hosts` file

#### Mesh Layer (FMP)

- Self-organized core mesh routing protocol with adaptive least cost forwarding
- Noise IK hop-by-hop link encryption with mutual authentication and replay protection between peer nodes
- Distributed spanning tree construction with cost-based parent selection and adaptive reconfiguration
- Destination route discovery via bloom filter-based directed search protocol
- Path MTU discovery with per-link MTU tracking and MtuExceeded error signaling
- Link-layer MMP: SRTT, jitter, one-way delay trends, packet loss, and ETX metrics
- Link-layer heartbeat with configurable liveness timeout for dead peer detection
- Epoch-based peer restart detection
- Automatic link rekeying with K-bit epoch coordination and drain window
- Static peer auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
- Multi-address peers with transport priority-based failover
- Msg1 rate limiting for handshake DoS protection

#### Mesh Peer Transports

- UDP overlay transport with inbound and static outbound peer configuration
- TCP overlay transport with listening port and static outbound peer support
- Ethernet/WiFi transport (MAC address based, no IP stack) with optional automatic peer discovery and auto-connect

#### Operator Tooling

- Ephemeral or persistent node identity with key file management
- Unix domain control socket for runtime observability
- `fipsctl` CLI tool for control socket interaction and node management
- Comprehensive node and transport statistics via control socket
- `fipstop` TUI monitoring tool with real-time session, peer, and transport configuration and metrics display

#### Packaging and Deployment

- Debian/Ubuntu `.deb` packaging via cargo-deb
- Systemd service packaging with tarball installer
- OpenWRT package with opkg feed and init script
- Docker sidecar deployment for containerized services
- Build version metadata: git commit hash, dirty flag, and target triple
  embedded in all binaries via `--version`

#### Testing and CI

- Comprehensive unit and integration tests covering all protocol layers and transports
- Docker test harness with static and stochastic topologies
- Chaos testing with simulated severe network conditions: latency, packet loss, reordering, and peer churn
- CI with GitHub Actions: x86_64 and aarch64, integration test matrix, nextest JUnit reporting
- Local CI runner script (`testing/ci-local.sh`)
