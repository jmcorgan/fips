# Bottleneck Parent: 10-node focused Bluetooth bottleneck test
#
# Explicit topology with two Bluetooth (L2CAP) links that create
# bottleneck parent candidates. Tests that nodes avoid choosing
# Bluetooth parents when fiber alternatives exist at the same or
# slightly greater depth.
#
# Topology:
#
#        n01 (root)
#       / | \  \
#      f  f  f  f
#     /   |   \  \
#   n02  n03  n04 n05
#    |  / | \   |
#    BT f  f    BT
#    | /  |   \  |
#   n06  n07  n08 n09
#              |
#              f
#              |
#             n10
#
# Edges and link types:
#   Fiber:     n01-n02, n01-n03, n01-n04, n01-n05,
#              n03-n06, n03-n07, n04-n08, n08-n10
#   Bluetooth: n02-n06, n05-n09
#
# Cross-links: n03-n08 (fiber) — gives n08 a fiber alternative to n04
#
# Test subjects:
#   - n06 has Bluetooth (n02) and fiber (n03) at depth 1 — should pick n03
#   - n09 has only Bluetooth (n05) — no alternative, stuck with BT parent
