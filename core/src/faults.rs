//! Test-only switches, each of which puts back one break of the mutation
//! lane.
//!
//! A switch is the shape a real defect took, or the smallest change that
//! fixes a known defect, written in the code behind one condition rather
//! than kept as a patch. `testing/mutations/run.sh` runs each test its
//! manifest names in its own process with the switch's name set, and
//! classifies the run; a switch whose tests stay green is a guard that
//! guards nothing.
//!
//! One list holds every switch, whichever crate its site is in. A site is
//! `node_fault!(Name)`, defined once in each crate's root: in test builds it
//! asks [`on`], and in any other build it is the literal `false`, so a
//! normal or release build compiles the branch away. This crate's sites see
//! the module through `cfg(test)` and the root crate's through the
//! `test-hooks` feature, which the root enables from its
//! `[dev-dependencies]` only.
//!
//! The set is read once per process from the `FIPS_NODE_FAULTS`
//! environment variable, a comma-separated list of variant names, and an
//! unknown name panics. A test in a shared binary cannot set it, so the
//! reading is split: [`parse`] is pure, and the process's set goes through
//! [`load`], which a test can call with any text.
//!
//! The switches of the rekey machine (`proto/rekey/faults.rs`) and of the
//! settlement core stay with their own meta-tests.
